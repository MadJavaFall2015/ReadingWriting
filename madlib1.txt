Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who decided to build
themselves houses. The first pig was ADJ1, and he built
his house out of NOUN1. The second pig worked very
ADVERB.and built a house out of NOUN2. But
the third pig was ADJ2. He built his house out of
NOUN3 and LIQUID. Then one day a big wolf came
along. When he saw the first pig's house, he VERB1 and he
VERB2 until he blew it down. Then he blew down the second
pig's NOUN1. But no matter how hard he VERB3,
he couldn't blow down the third pig's NOUN2.
